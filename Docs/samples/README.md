# Sample Packages and Configurations

This folder contains local sample files used by the Marketplace features and configuration examples.

- `widgets/` – sample widget JSON files
- `layouts/` – sample layout definitions
- `themes/` – sample theme stylesheets
- `cloud/` – sample cloud function info

Reference these files in your configuration or replace them with URLs to your own packages when deploying to production.

## Sync Nodes

The example `sync_nodes.json` file points here so you can document your own node URLs. Update it with reachable addresses in production.

## Failover

Use this section to list standby or failover nodes referenced by
`disaster_recovery.json`. Replace these placeholders with your actual addresses.
